### Prerequisites
-Install operating system that best work for you.
-Install the latest version of node.

  and add node_modules to it:
- you need to initialize npm to create package.json file
- run npm install --save-dev hint@6.x
  -add hintrc
  -run npx hint .
- .stylelintrc
- run npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x
- run npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
