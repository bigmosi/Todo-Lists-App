## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
-Install operating system that best work for you.
-Install the latest version of node.
Install your favorite Text Editor
### Setup
- Set-up linters in your local env
- The npm package manager is going to create a node_modules directory to install all of your dependencies.You shouldn't commit that directory. To avoid that, you can create a .gitignore file
  and add node_modules to it:
- you need to initialize npm to create package.json file
- run npm install --save-dev hint@6.x
  -add hintrc
  -run npx hint .
- .stylelintrc
- run npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x
- run npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
### Install
